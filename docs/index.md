# Sym Provider

The Sym Terraform Provider allows you to declaratively provision Flows. It also provides several types of resources that can be used to configure Flows.

## Authentication
Authentication for the Sym Provider can be derived from two sources, which are applied in the following order:
1. A [Bot Token](https://docs.symops.com/docs/using-bot-tokens) set as the environment variable `SYM_JWT`
2. The config generated from a successful`symflow login`.
This order matches the precedence used by the `symflow` CLI.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "sym" {
  org = "my-sym-org"
}
```
